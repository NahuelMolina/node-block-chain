This is an block-chain model make it on node environment. I look if this is able to use.. i wonder if this work
## Usage
First of you should have installed Node environment on your machine and insert the follow command line (cmd on Windows) on the father folder
```bash
npm install
```
This way you'll have the dependencies necesarlies and now yout'll write the nest command line
```bash
npm run dev
```
